# MNIST-WGAN
Functional code has been achieved!

Work is currently focused on debugging, after which partial conv based padding will be added.

In order to use the project on an alternative dataset, one must replace the MNIST files, then rewrite IO.FindNextNumber (and corresponding file paths) to read the desired file. Nothing else stops this from being done.
