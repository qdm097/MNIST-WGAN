# MNIST-WGAN
This project is currently in development, with work focused on the GAN aspect of things. It is planned to be a Weierstrass GAN upon completion, but this will occur sometime after the base type is completed. 
While presntly nonfunctional, I hope to have a beta out by May 21st (though this is looking unlikely).
