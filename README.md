# MNIST-WGAN
The project is now feature complete, though partial conv based padding may be added.
<br>Other than that only a GUI update remains before the project is finished.

In order to use the project on an alternative dataset, one must replace the MNIST files, then rewrite IO.FindNextNumber (and corresponding file paths) to read the desired file. Nothing else stops this from being done.
